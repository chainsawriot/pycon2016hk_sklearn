# pycon2016hk_sklearn

1. Setup

Get the Linux VM here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz_b4-2EHFopQWl2d1lxdHlGd28/view?usp=sharing

You don't need this VM if you know how to use pip, virtualenv and brew/apt-get on your own machine. If you are using Windows or you don't know what I'm talking about, please use the VM.

Download Virtual Box (https://www.virtualbox.org/) and then File -> Import Appliance.

Username and password for the VM is 'pycon'

If you know how to do so, please switch on the VM and then download the Anaconda Python Distribution.

```
wget https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda2-4.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Also, download the dataset and notebooks from here. (You can clone if you know how to do so.)
